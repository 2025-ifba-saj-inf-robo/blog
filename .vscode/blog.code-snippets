	// Place your blog workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	 "javacode": {
	 	"scope": "markdown",
	 	"prefix": "java",
	 	"body": [
	 		"```java",
	 		"$1",
			"```"
	 	],
	 	"description": "java code snippet"
	 },
	 "plantumlcode": {
		"scope": "markdown",
		"prefix": "plantuml",
		"body": [
			"```plantuml {kroki=true}",
			"$1",
		   "```"
		],
		"description": "plantuml code snippet"
	},
	"run": {
	   "scope": "markdown",
	   "prefix": "run",
	   "body": ["<codapi-snippet sandbox=\"java\" editor=\"basic\"></codapi-snippet>"],
	   "description": "run java code"
   }
